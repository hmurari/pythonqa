### Types of Test Automation

There are several types of test automation, each focusing on different aspects of software testing:

1. **Unit Testing**: This involves testing individual components or units of code to ensure that they function correctly. For example, testing a single function in a Python script to verify that it returns the correct output for a given input.

``` python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
```

1. **Integration Testing**: This type of testing focuses on the interactions between different components or modules within a software system. For example, testing how a web application communicates with a database to retrieve and display data.

1. **System Testing**: System testing evaluates the entire software system, including its interfaces with other systems, to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. For example, testing an e-commerce website's ability to handle user registration, product browsing, and order processing.

1. **Acceptance Testing**: This final stage of testing is performed to verify that the software meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. It often involves testing the software from the end-user's perspective. For example, testing a web application's user interface and functionality to ensure it is user-friendly and meets customer expectations.

In the following sections, we will focus on using Python for various types of test automation, including web automation, web API testing, and web scraping.
